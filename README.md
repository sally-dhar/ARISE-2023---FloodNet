### ARISE 2023 - FloodNet

NYU Tandon's summer ARISE program partners up New York City high school juniors and seniors with a NYU lab to gain STEM research skills and experience. By being paired up with mentors and researchers in the lab, ARISE students conducr research under their guidance. FloodNet is a team of researchers that focuses on civil and urban engineering that produces low-cost flood sensors. The creation of these flood sensors aims to measure and understand the severity of flooding in New York City. The data obtained with these sensors help prevent flood risks by monitoring real-time flood data.

Worked with Polly Pierone by finding longitude and latitude for flood locations requested by the Department of Transportation (DOT). 
Organized longitude and latitude for addresses where requests were sent out to deploy flood sensors. Also helped organize the dates of requests sent out in the sensor suggestion forms.
