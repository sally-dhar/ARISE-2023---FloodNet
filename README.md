# ARISE 2023 - FloodNet 
NYU Tandon's summer ARISE program partners up New York City high school juniors and seniors with a NYU lab to gain STEM research skills and experience. By being paired up with mentors and researchers in the lab, ARISE students conducr research under their guidance. FloodNet is a team of researchers that focuses on civil and urban engineering that produces low-cost flood sensors. The creation of these flood sensors aims to measure and understand the severity of flooding in NYC. The data obtained with these sensors helps prevent flood risks by monitoring real-time flood data.

#### Introduction

As flooding poses as a public health risk in NYC, FloodNet offers a flood sensor that can track data quantitatively. By designing and deploying sensors that can monitor real-time data, it can help tackle the difficulty of measuring the severity of floods. Residents and communities will be able to access these low-cost sensors to ensure safety within their neighborhoods. The FloodNet team's aim of implementing a city-wide sensor network addresses the evolving impacts NYC face; such as population density, land devolopment, and climate development. In collaboration with communities, researchers, and New York government agencies, neighborhoods that are in high risk of extreme weather conditions will efficiently resolve long-term impacts from flooding. These sensors are capable of recording data from extreme weather conditions such as high tides, storm surge, and stormwater runoff. The precision these sensors offer can allow policy makers, emergency response teams, community advocacy groups, and researchers advocate to better resolve and manage public health concerns.

Worked with Polly Pierone by finding longitude and latitude for flood locations requested by the Department of Transportation (DOT). 
Organized longitude and latitude for addresses where requests were sent out to deploy flood sensors. Also helped organize the dates of requests sent out in the sensor suggestion forms.
